# Prologue

It was a sunny evening and I was in a great hurry to catch my train which was about to start in 20 minutes. I keep on looking at my Watch for every minute and calculating the probability of catching the train. As soon as the taxi arrived at the station, I pulled out my bag, paid the fare and started rushing into the station.

My eyes was searching for the platform number of "Alleppey Express" from Chennai to Kerala on the digital board. It was platform 3, I hurried to the platform. After running a hundred meters hurdles, I found my couch and sat on my seat with full sweaty face. I wasn't bothered to wipe the sweat on my face leaving it to the responsibility of the moving train's window air. 

The person sitting opposite offered me water after seeing me panting for breath. Although there is a water bottle somewhere inside my bag, I was weary to find it. I returned back the water bottle with a "thanks". I was actually heading to my sister's home at Tirupur for the weekend. Its been ten minutes since the train started and I took a book from my bag and started to read it.  

The person who offered me water, gradually started the conversation by asking me "To kerala?". I said No, I am going to my sister's home for weekend. What about you?

To Kerala for a business meet. By the way, I am Raj working as a Project Manager in a Top MNC.

That's short and sweet. Raj looks like a normal Chennaiwala, should be in his 40's, wheatish skin, square face, just above average body. His branded Tee and shoe ensures that he works for an IT company.He is friendly, polite and cordial. Our conversation extended for a hour until the train stopped in the next station. I bought coffee for both of us in the station.

Raj asked me, "Do you love anyone?". I said "No, I'm not that much lucky". He smiled and told that you are lucky enough to escape from the clutches of Love.Being in love had more cons than pros.Love gives you more pain that you had ever imagined. You'll get distracted, make you insecure, jealous, forgetful, show disinterest on everything. You will lose hours of your peaceful sleep at nights thinking about your partner. I was bewildered after hearing his discourse on love.He might have a love failure which put him in agony and that should be the reason for this discourse.

It seems, you've been affected with this love failure syndrome right?. Yes, not once but "FIVE Times". He started to narrate his love stories right from his childhood. This book is a set of all his love stories which has all mixed feelings.

**But more than anything else, LOVE IS AN WONDERFUL FEELING.
