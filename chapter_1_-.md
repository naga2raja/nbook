# Chapter 1 - "So, this is not Love"

I was studying second standard in a well-known school in Chennai. I have two sisters with big age difference. The elder sister got married and younger sister was studying 12th standard on the same school.

"This time also third Rank", Mom gave a strict look at me holding my report card. You got good marks in all subject except Maths. Her pause indirectly asking me the reason for lesser marks in Maths.

"I will try to get first rank next time", I repeat the same dialog which I said last time. Mom was not much worried about my marks, in-fact my sisters wont even get ranks. Her intention is to say to our neighbors that my boy scored third rank this time and what about your son?

In school, there are some gang of girls providing statistical analysis of ranks after giving each test marks.  According to their analysis I ranked first prior to Maths mark. But due to my lower marks in Maths, I descended back to third rank. This happens every time.
