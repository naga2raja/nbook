Prologue

It was a sunny evening and I was in a great hurry to catch my train which was about to start in few minutes. I keep on looking at my Watch for every minute and calculating the probability of catching the train. After running hundred meters hurdles, I caught the train and sat on my seat with full sweaty face. I wasn't bothered to wipe the sweat on my face leaving it to the responsibility of the moving train's window air. The person sitting opposite offered me water after seeing me panting for breath. Although there is a water bottle somewhere inside my bag, I was weary to find it.
